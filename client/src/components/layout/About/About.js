<Card image="/assets/images/2-men-with-canes.png" content={<p><center>Walk Safe</center><br></br>Walk Safe is a valuable resource for testing walking safety in the older adult. It provides useful information to help an older or unsteady person get stronger and prevent falls. Walk Safe test determines a need for an assistive device and whether or a medical provider should be involved. The video library demonstrates assistive devices and proper use of rollators, canes and walkers. Most program exercises are done in a chair, on the floor or with a walker so you can follow along with ease.

Many falls are while older adults are walking.<br></br>2. Walking alone does not significantly improve walking safety or prevent falls. Specific strength training does improve safety.<br></br> 3. The cost of older adult falls is expected to increase as the population ages reaching $67.7 billion by 2020.<br></br> 4. Every 19 minutes, an older adult dies from a fall.<br></br>5.

What is the core 5? The core 5 exercise program is the key to safe walking that you can do at home. These exercises work the most common 5 muscle pairs physical therapists use in a home exercise program to produce safer walking and improved neck mobility for environmental scanning. Go to the strength library to find the core 5 videos - do them at least 3 times a week and retest to see if you arenâ€™t walking safer and feeling stronger. You can track your test progress and log in core 5 in your dashboard. </p>} action="About Us" href="/videolibrary"/>
