# Walk Safe

Walk Safe is a full stack MERN application that provides valuable exercise and safety information to help an older or unsteady person walk safely in order to prevent falls. It provides a test to determine need for an assistive device, what type, when to use and whether or not a medical provider should be involved. 

It provides information for home modification and general safety to improve balance. It tracks the users exercise and test scores to monitor for improvement and increases in safe walking. A user that is logged in can take the test and track exercise and prior test scores. A user not logged in can view safety and home mod information.
